### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khadijat and I am a Junior Full Stack Developer based in London. I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend of an application, as I like seeing how everything comes together, but I am particularly fond of design.

Some of the technologies I have worked with include:
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- JavaScript
- React
- Java
- SQL

My projects:
- <a href="https://github.com/Khadijat98/calculator-challenge">Calculator</a>: A simple JS graphical calculator
- <a href="https://github.com/Khadijat98/tic-tac-toe">Tic Tac Toe</a> A school-inspired JS-based game of Tic Tac Toe
- <a href="https://github.com/Khadijat98/morse-code-translator">Morse Code Translator</a> A test-driven JS-based morse code translator
