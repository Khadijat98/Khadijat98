### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khadijat and I am a Junior Full Stack Developer based in London. I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend of an application, as I like seeing how everything comes together, but I am particularly fond of design.

Some of the technologies I have worked with include:
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- JavaScript
- React
- Java
- SQL
